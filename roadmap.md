To be implemented:
- Shell keybinds (figure out how to implement)
- Help page
- Theme support (Possibly custom ascii logo per theme?)
`print('Chameleons can change colour!)`
- Better looking commands with tab completion (A bit like Claude Code) and / commands (specifically for chameleoncode only) or . commands
- setup.py file (Colours, pip install -r libs/requirements.txt)
- Credits command (If it becomes Open Source)
- Implement cd and full terminal compatibility (Though not cmd + click as this would require a complete reimplemntation of the terminal system)
- Implement consistent functions with frameworks
